# CodeManiacs

CodeManiacs is an online judge for IIT Mandi. It helps students of IIT Mandi practice problems, host contests and allows them to compete on a personal platform, specifically made for them.

## Getting Started

Install the Node Package Manager 
```bash
$ sudo snap install node --classic --channel=10
$ npm install nodemon -g
```

Fork this repo and clone it
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<Your User Name>/CodeManiacs.git
```

Open the folder CodeManiacs and install the dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

Next you need to set the database configurations. Create a `database.js` file in the config folder, and add the following to it.
```
module.exports = {
    database: "mongodb://localhost/codemaniacs",
    secret: "Ask-Secret-From-Us"
}
```

Make sure you have mongodb installed. Then, run the following 
```bash
$ sudo service mongod start
```

Now, run the application
```bash
$ nodemon
```

The server runs at port 3000 i.e. http://localhost:3000/

## Next Steps
Open localhost:3000 in your browser and create a new user profile.

You will need admin access to create problems, make contests etc. 
So to gain admin access, open MongoDB compass (or use command line) and edit the users collection by setting `isAdmin` to true.

Doing this will provide you admin access, and then you can explore the full functionality.
